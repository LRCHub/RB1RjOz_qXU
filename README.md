[00:09.64] Do you remember snow was falling down on Christmas day?
[00:17.81] Oh, baby, I thought forever was a gift that we gave
[00:22.65] Holding you so tight by the fireplace, yeah
[00:28.18] The list of everything that I could want written on my face
[00:36.24] But no, 'cause Santa didn't bring me nothing but pain
[00:41.07] So the holidays don't hit the same
[00:58.07] 
[00:45.76] Now December 25th is the day I always miss you the most, oh-oh
[00:54.80] 'Cause the music and the lights
[00:57.52] It reminds me of the night that you told me you had to go
[01:04.56] December 25th is the day that always hurts me the most, oh-oh
[01:13.78] I still got no goodbye
[01:15.95] So I'd rather stay inside, spending Christmas here alone
[01:43.95] 
[01:24.26] Na-la-la-la, mm-na-na-na-na
[01:29.61] Ooh-ooh
[01:33.11] 
[01:32.87] I got a chill that never goes away
[01:36.53] When the seasons change
[01:40.91] Ooh, 'cause every year when Christmas comes back around
[01:45.88] All I do is wish you (wish you) would've stayed
[02:09.38] 
[01:50.35] Now December 25th is the day I always miss you the most (I'm missing you most), oh-oh
[01:59.33] 'Cause the music and the lights (music and the lights)
[02:02.11] It reminds me of the night (it reminds me of the night)
[02:04.45] That you told me you had to go
[02:19.45] 
[02:08.91] December 25th is the day that always hurts me the most (this day hurts me the most), oh-oh
[02:18.38] I still got no goodbye (I still got no goodbye)
[02:20.41] So I'd rather stay inside (so I'd rather stay inside)
[02:22.87] Spending Christmas here alone
[02:37.37] 
[02:28.59] What a gift to kiss you once more (to kiss you once more)
[02:32.20] Beneath the mistletoe (beneath the mistletoe)
[02:37.67] Waiting for you to come back, it'd be like a Christmas miracle
[03:08.67] 
[02:45.81] Now December 25th is the day I always miss you the most, oh-oh
[02:54.74] 'Cause the music and the lights
[02:57.52] It reminds me of the night that you told me you had to go
[03:26.02] 
[03:04.22] On December 25th is the day that always hurts me the most (this day hurts me the most), oh-oh
[03:13.78] I still got no goodbye (I still got no goodbye)
[03:15.91] So I'd rather stay inside (so I'd rather stay inside)
[03:18.25] Spending Christmas here alone
[03:32.75] 
[03:26.75] Christmas here alone, alone
[03:33.26] Spending Christmas
[03:35.86] Christmas here alone
[03:40.09] Ooh-ooh
